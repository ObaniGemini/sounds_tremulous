# Tremulous sounds

**This repository will contain most of my finished works for tremulous sound effects**

####Organization

**Issues** are there to make proponals or to give ideas on the realization of a special sound. Issues will be classified with some specific labels.


If you want some sounds to be added to the core game, [open an issue](https://github.com/ObaniGemini/sounds_tremulous/issues) to request it and a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ObaniGemini/sounds_tremulous/pulls) might follow quickly.

You can contact me on ***irc.freenode.net #tremulous*** most of the time.
